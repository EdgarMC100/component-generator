Your goal is to improve the component generation prompt at @src/lib/prompts/generation.tsx. Here's how:
1.Open a browser and navigate to localhost:3000
2.Request a basic component to be generated
3. Review the genereated component and its source code
4.Identify areas for improvement
5.Update the prompt to produce better components going forward

For now, only evaluate visual styling aspects. We don't want components generated that look like typical tailwindcss components, we want something more original.
